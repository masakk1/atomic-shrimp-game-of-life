# Atomic Shrimp's Idea
1. Using letters of the alphabet instead of blocks
2. Instead of Life & Dead, change state of the letter
    - General relationships of vowels and consonants
    - Pairing "Q" and "U"
    - Frequency of letters occuring in English (or other language)
3. Tune the weights on purpose
4. See what happens
